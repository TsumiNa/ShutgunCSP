# Shotgun CSP

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/TsumiNa/ShutgunCSP)

**Shotgun CSP** is a Python package designed to solve the crystal structure prediction (CSP) problem using a non-iterative, single-shot screening framework. This method leverages a large library of virtually created crystal structures and employs a machine-learning energy predictor for efficient and accurate predictions.

## Features

- Non-iterative, single-shot screening framework for CSP
- Transfer learning for accurate energy prediction
- Generative models based on element substitution (**ShotgunCSP-GT**) and symmetry-restricted structure generation (**ShotgunCSP-GW**)
- High prediction accuracy with reduced computational intensity

## Installation

To install **shotgun-csp**, you can use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
# Install poetry if you haven't already
pip install poetry

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shotgun-csp.git
cd shotgun-csp

# Install dependencies and package
poetry install
```

Alternatively, you can directly install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install shotgun-csp
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use **shotgun-csp**:

```python
from shotgun_csp.generator import TemplateSelector
from shotgun_csp.io import VASPInputGenerator

# Example usage
selector = TemplateSelector()
templates = selector.from(<pymatgen structures>, with='DBSCAN')

vasp_inputs = VASPInputGenerator(templates)
```
